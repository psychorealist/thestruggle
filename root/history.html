      <h1>Sahbaa Al-Barbari (Gaza)</h1>
      <p> &emsp;In 1947, we read in the newspapers about the clashes of the far-off places in north Palestine, when the Haganah and Irgun Zionist militias began planning to take over the towns adjacent to them. I didn’t understand what was going on then, but I remember my family following the news in the newspapers and trying to get information from people who were visiting Gaza from Jerusalem and Jaffa. I had never heard about these militia in Gaza, and perhaps all that I can remember of them was the talk about their colonies and the problems that they caused for Palestinians. I heard about the Rehovot colony from my father, who travelled a lot to Jaffa and the north.</p>

      <p> My mother, our neighbours, and other women helped the influx of refugees, numbering over two hundred thousand, almost four times the population of the Strip then. They were mostly peasants and landowners who suddenly ended up in the streets after being forced out of their homes and off their lands in 1948. They lost everything and became homeless. They were everywhere and could be spotted in any of Gaza’s corners. Many of these refugees had nothing, literally nothing, as they were fleeing for their lives, and they were probably thinking that they wouldn’t stay that long before they could return <span class="homeflash"><a href="home.html">home</span></a>.</p>

      <h1>Ghada Karmi (Jerusalem)</h1>
      <p>&emsp;And so it was that on that morning of 27 April 1948,we saw our house for the last time. But we did not know that then,and when my mother packed for our journey,she only took one suitcase,certain we would be back soon. She would not even let me take my bedraggled but much loved teddybear named Beta (after an English friend of my fathers, called Peter). All our belongings , papers and documents, family photographs and mementos-our whole history-was left behind forever.</p>
      <p>Tha event marked the end of my childhood. As the taxi drew up to the house that last morning and my parents started to pack it with our overcoats and few belongings, I was suddenly overwhelmed by gloomand loneliness. Fatima and our half-Alsatian mongrel dog, Rex, whom we children doted on, were to staybehind. I still remember with what passion mybrother and I begged Fatima to come with us to Damascus.She refused, saying she preferred to stay in her own village, and I remember my mother giving her the key to the house and asking her to look after our affairs until we returned. I do not know what became of her, for her village, al-Maliha, was attacked and its inhabitants partly evacuated by the Zionists in early May, shortly after we left. A few months later,in July 1948, it was attacked again by the Irgun gang and all its people were expelled. I suppose that she must have died by now,though God knows how and in what refugee camp.</p>
      <p>As the car drew away from the house, I knelt on the back seat to reach the rear window and take a last look back. Andt here I saw an ominous sight. Rex, who was never normally allowed to go outside the gate for fear of being runover, was standing in the middle of the road, his tail stiff, staring after our retreating car. It was then that all the half-digested ,half-understood events in Palestine that had mysteriously over shadowed my short life coalesced into a kind of premonition, and I knew that something truly awfulhad happened to us.</p>

      <h1>MUHAMMAD HALLAJ (Jaffa)</h1>
      <p>&emsp;I remember that when a battle raged around Qalqilya, which happened frequently, volunteers went knocking on doors to collect food to feed the fighters. People gave of what they had: a loaf of bread here, a boiled egg there, a handful of olives, a piece of cheese—whatever people could spare. That was how Qalqilya defended itself in 1948.</p>

      <p>The cleverest act of resistance undertaken by the people of Qalqilya was deceiving their enemies so as to dissuade them from attacking the town. One day, the Jews were seen mobilizing a large number of vehicles and troops in the orange groves just west of Qalqilya. Fearing that they were launching their biggest effort yet to overrun the town, people arranged for trucks (of which Qalqilya, a prosperous farming town, had dozens, previously used to transport produce every day) to drive out of town and return under the cover of darkness with their headlights blazing, then go out of town again without lights, only to return to town a second time, creating the impression that reinforcements were pouring into Qalqilya to help defend it. Qalqilya was not attacked, and we slept soundly that night.</p>

      <p>As the autumn progressed, the situation grew more desperate. I was a senior by then at the Khadduri School in Tulkarm, which was right on the front line. One day, as we walked around the schoolyard during recess, we saw UN soldiers stretching a barbed wire across the fields just west of town. They were demarcating a “truce” or “cease-fire” line between the new state of Israel and us. Witnessing our country being dismembered and torn from our hands and hearts before our eyes, we felt that as high school seniors we were old enough to do something about what was being done to us and our country. Despite what we had already seen of the Arab performance, we decided to volunteer. We elected a committee that would go to offer our services to the commander of the nearest Arab military camp, which belonged to the Iraqi army. When the committee representatives returned, they reported that our offer to volunteer had been rejected because “they didn’t have boots for us.” It was terrible tohave to watch helplessly, as a mere spectator, while your people and your country were being torn apart. This was probably the hardest thing that young Palestinians who lived through the events of 1948 had to endure emotionally.</p>
      <p>
      I don’t know how many people died defending Qalqilya and keeping it from becoming a part of Israel in 1948, but I remember that so many people were dying that extra graves were dug in the town’s cemetery and kept in reserve to be used as needed. </p>
