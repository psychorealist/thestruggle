      <h1>Recounts of Khalid Farraj during the first intifada</h1>
      <p class="cl">In 1987, Palestinians under occupation also said ‘enough is enough’. It began with the killing of four unarmed labourers from the Jabalya refugee camp in Gaza, who were run over by Israeli soldiers in what Israel called an accident, and Palestinians eyewitnesses called a deliberate act of vengeance following the deaths of six Israeli soldiers at the hands of two Arab resistance fighters. This was the beginning of the First Intifada.</p>
      <h1>The first intifada ended with Oslo accords while the second started following the faliure of the Camp David Summit</h1>

      <p class="cr">In February 1988, Minister of Defense Yitzhak Rabin, whom the Norwegian Nobel Committee would subsequently crown a hero, gave the army the order to break the limbs of the youth revolting in the streets of the West Bank and Gaza. As subsequent video footage would reveal, this was like a heaven-sent gift for the soldiers and officers: they did not hold back as they broke youthful bones throughout the occupied territories, and bragged about it.</p>




      <p>The failure of Fateh to serve as a leader of resistance, combined with the internal
corruption of the PA in the late 1990s and its inability to provide social services,
created a space for the rising influence of Hamas, which had several implications
for popular resistance. First, it shifted the focus of the popular struggle from
strategic nonviolence, as employed during the first intifada, to armed resistance,
thus militarizing the struggle and, in doing so, limiting opportunities for popular
participation. Second, rising tensions between Hamas and Fateh fractured resistance
against the occupation, as the parties either organized their own separate
actions against the occupation, or prioritized their mobilization regarding the
internal struggle over resisting the occupation.</p>


<h2>The Second intifada </h2>

<article class="ctend">


<p >Following the second Intifada, Israel erracted the separation wall between the west bank and the 1948 occupied terratories. This was followed by increased military presence by the IDF in the West Bank. This leads to what is going in the last ten years. From the silent intifada in Jerusalem in 2014, the May uprising of 2021, and most recently to the killing of Palestinian journalist shireen abu akleh that marked to continued anger and call for chnage by the Palestinian people.</p>
<p>
Throughout these years, conflict in the Gaza strip continous with Israeli airforce bombing civilian locations under the pretence of fighting Hamas, who themsleve responed with violence in kind. </p>

<p>Continuing the cycle of death and destruction, children grow up losing their friends to airstrikes and raids. Any child born before 2008 would’ve lived through 4 wars in Gaza. While countless raids, arrests, barriers, and checkpoints. Separate families in the West Bank. </p>
